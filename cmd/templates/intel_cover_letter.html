          <p>Greetings,</p>
          <p>I am currently a high school math and computer science teacher in pursuit of a challenging and interesting career in software. I am driven by a passion to create and constantly evolve, and I am looking for a company that encourages employees to grow their skills while solving challenging and interesting problems. I have worked for Intel previously--as a high-school contractor, a college intern, and briefly as a full-time employee--and I come from an Intel family. The workplace culture is both familiar and appealing to me: the challenging and supportive environment that encourages excellence and accountability, while still emphasizing work-life balance. I want to work at Intel not only because of the engaging work to be done, but also because the culture of the company aligns with my own beliefs and values. </p>
          <p>Programming and technology have always been passions of mine; my first degree was in computer science, and I took as many pure theory classes as I could. After finishing a bachelor’s degree, I went to graduate school to study artificial intelligence. I decided to put grad school on hold after two terms to develop a deeper understanding of the math necessary for AI, completing a post-bac degree in mathematics. It was while pursuing this degree that I discovered an interest in teaching and changed my career path. At the time I was working for Intel as a manufacturing technician. I had to make a difficult decision to give up something familiar and comfortable (though not really in line with my career goals), or take a risk and push myself beyond my comfort zone. Ultimately, I chose the latter.</p>
          <p>My life has been changed by a few good teachers, and I was motivated by the opportunity to be that person for someone else. Teaching has allowed me to have a direct, positive influence on my community and has been very rewarding in many ways. However, two years ago I began teaching a coding class that reawakened my passion for programming. I realized how much I missed it, and since then I began diving head-first back into learning new technologies and solving classic challenges. </p>
          <p>Of course, I would not be applying for a developer position if I didn’t believe I had the programming skills to be successful. A formal education trained me to be analytical and detail-oriented, and years of exposure to myriad technologies in varied contexts has given me a broad set of technical skills to draw from.  I know a few programming languages well and am familiar with many others. Java and C were my primary languages through college, for fundamentals courses like data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and compilers. Since leaving school, I have exposed myself to many different languages and technologies because of professional need or personal curiosity. </p>
          <p>I am currently teaching a coding class using Python, so that has been my main language of choice for the past three years. Outside of the classroom, my interest recently has been on full-stack web development, mosty to build a personal website that I can experiment with. Leaning on my Python experience, I built the site using Flask as the backend framework with a MySQL database. I wanted to have full control of my server to allow more flexibility in the framework(s) I might end up using, and also to learn what it takes to run a web server properly. I rent a virtual Ubuntu server and administer the site myself entirely through SSH. </p>
          <p>I share this example because it demonstrates how I approach learning a new skill. I like to fully understand what I’m doing and the tools I’m using, rather than getting by with a surface level understanding. I believe this helps (a) to troubleshoot when things inevitably go sideways, and (b) give me a holistic view of the problem domain. Although I lack a plethora of recent industry experience, I strongly believe that, if given the opportunity, I can quickly become proficient in the requisite technologies and become a contributing team member. Learning and growing my skills have been constant in my life, both educationally and professionally, and I actively seek out opportunities to learn something new.</p>
          <p>Though I am leaving education, I do not regret becoming a teacher. It has pushed me to grow both personally and professionally. We often talk of “transferable skills” in education, and there is much that I can take from this career and apply it to the next:
            <ul>
              <li><b>How to “own” problems:</b> As a teacher you are also often the first person to identify problems students struggle with, academically or personally. Ignoring these issues can have real and long-lasting consequences for students, and runs counter to the moral-imperative of teachers to help all students be successful. That professional requirement has translated to my personal beliefs and reinforced my identity as a problem-solver: I own the problem until it is solved or I find someone better qualified to help solve it.</li>
              <li><b>How to be a leader:</b> As a youth I would rarely seek out explicit leadership opportunities, preferring to simply lead by example. As I became comfortable and confident in my role as a teacher, I began taking on more leadership roles in my school and district. These roles included coaching multiple sports (as both assistant and head coach); mentoring underrepresented STEM students; being a contributing member of the district-level math teacher workgroup; and being one of four math teachers representing the district in the Washington State Teaching Fellows Network, among other roles. </li>
              <li><b>The power of collaboration on a well-functioning team:</b> I was hired in a wave of new math teachers who were young and excited, full of bold new ideas we weren’t afraid to try. We put our egos aside and shared successes while supporting each other through difficulties. All of us were better teachers for it, and over the next four years our students’ growth outperformed nearly every middle school in the district.</li>
              <li><b>How to constantly reflect on my work and evolve/learn:</b> Over the seven years of my teaching, there have only been two years I have not taught something new. With each new course comes both a new curriculum (what to teach) and a new pedagogy (how to teach it). To be a successful teacher is to be a lifelong learner.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>I have years of experience that have furthered the development of my “soft-skills” necessary for success in any industry. In short, this will not be my first career. I know what it means to work in an environment that is high-paced, complex, stressful, and rewarding all at once. While I may not have the particular experiences that come with being on a team of software developers, teaching, like software development, is not a solitary profession. Teachers work in a flat organizational structure, where content-area teams have a high level of autonomy over the details of teaching their subject. I have experienced the value of collaboration with a team of motivated and skilled colleagues; and the frustration of being part of a team whose standards and drive do not match my own. </p>
          <p>I am at an inflection point in my life, where I can take the skills I have learned teaching and apply them to my next career. Programming may not require me to engage and motivate groups of 30+ people every day, but every job requires cooperation, communication, collaboration, and accountability; skills gained through hands-on experience. Owning my work and being proud of what I have accomplished are important to me, and I want to find a place where I can be challenged, supported, and pushed to excel as part of a cohesive whole. I believe that Intel is that place. Thank you for considering my application for this position.</p>
          <p>Respectfully,<br>
            Colin Douglas</p>
